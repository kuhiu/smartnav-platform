For microblaze, replace the ONCE macro

For some reason the systemd developers decided that needed to hardcode
the usage of __sync_bool_compare_and_swap, however not all architectures
define this.  Microblaze is one such architecture, so we fall back to
a less 'safe' way of doing the work.  However a quick inspection of
the ONCE users shows that even if we end up with a race condition the
worst expected behavior could be multiple log messages.
